# ML Interview Challenges

A collection of Machine Learning and AI coding challenges from technical interviews.

## Overview

This repository contains small-scale ML/AI projects and coding challenges encountered during technical interviews. It serves as a reference and learning resource for common ML interview problems.

> **Note**: This repository is dedicated to smaller challenges and interview projects only. Larger ML/AI projects are maintained in separate repositories.

## Projects

| Name | Area | Main Task | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Satellite Building Detection | Computer Vision / Remote Sensing | Semantic Segmentation | Building detection model using satellite imagery with 10m resolution. Implements semantic segmentation to identify buildings, evaluated using IoU metrics and deployable via CPU-based CLI tool. |
